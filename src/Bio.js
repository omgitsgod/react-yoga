      <p><b>Once ridden with eczema on my arms and legs, I asked my mom to purchase a yoga mat for my 15th birthday. I would find myself brushing my teeth in tree pose, a yoga pose I learned from watching Alan
                Finger and his students on the television show, Yogazone. Yoga healed my eczema by providing me with strategies to deal with stress. At the same time, yoga was a gateway to a living a more spiritual and authentic life. Seventeen
                years later, I am still learning and growing from the dynamic changes that occur through a consistent yoga and mindfulness practice.
                Equanimity is a practice where what you invest, you get back tenfold.</b></p>

                Equanimity Yoga intends to keep the yoga practice simple. The studio mat is fully padded so those with sensitive knees can practice in a space with a built in cushion. We ask that you sign a quick waiver and payment for class is
                $10 cash. There are two large changing rooms and bathrooms.</b> </p>

                As an educator for public schools during the day, I understand that the “one size fits all” way of teaching does not work, espeically in a yoga setting. The class is mixed level which means that options are provided to increase or
                decrease the level of your practice. Classes are stuctured around a monthly theme.</b> </p>
